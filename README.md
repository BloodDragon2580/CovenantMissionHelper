# Covenant Mission Helper
<p align="center">
  
Main features

- [NEW] "Optimize" button changes the order of you troops to minimize HP loss
- Simulates mission round by round, considering unit's abilities
- If units have random abilities, addon simulates fight many times and estimates success rate
- Show remaining unit's health
- Show full combat log


Known issues:

- Doesn't support environment aura
- Bad target selection for "all adjacent allies" and "all adjacent enemies" mechanics 

Addon may contain other bugs, so I recommend to sent you troops if their remaining HP > 10% of total.
